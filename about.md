***
I am a third-year computer science student at the Turkish-German University. My passion and interest lie in the field of computer science, driven by my belief in the constantly evolving dynamics and opportunities of the technology world.

Throughout my education, I have had the opportunity to delve deep into subjects such as programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and software development processes. Additionally, I have been involved in various projects to enhance my project management, problem-solving, and communication skills. Transforming my knowledge in computer science into practical applications and staying updated with the latest developments in the field is the focal point of my career.

I will be sharing my research and development on my [blog](https://meliheyuboglu.github.io/) page.
