***
I am a third-year Computer Science student at Turkish-German University and have the privilege of leading the Software Department within our university's Teknofest team. 

My experience in teamwork is extensive, stemming from both my past internships and my involvement in the university's Teknofest team. To further enhance my skills, I am actively engaged in self-improvement through valuable resources such as Tryhackme and LetsDefend. These initiatives reflect my commitment to continuous learning and growth in the field of computer science. 

I will be sharing my research and development on my [blog](https://meliheyuboglu.github.io/) page.
