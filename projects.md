### Unmanned Ground Vehicle Project

I serve as the team leader for the Software Department within our Teknofest competition team, which comprises five dedicated members. My primary responsibilities within the competition encompass image processing and the precise control of our robotic arm. 

While these tasks may not be directly related to cybersecurity, they have provided me with invaluable experiences in the domains of teamwork and research. This hands-on involvement has been instrumental in my personal and professional development, reinforcing the significance of effective collaboration and the pursuit of knowledge.
