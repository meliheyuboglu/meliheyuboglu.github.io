### Unmanned Ground Vehicle Project

We are a team of 5 people in Teknofest competition and I am the
leader of this team's software department. In this competition, I was
responsible for image processing and control of the robotic arm.
Although it has nothing to do with cyber security, this is where I
learned the most of the teamwork and research.
